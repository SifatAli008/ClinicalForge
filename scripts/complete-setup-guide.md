# 🎉 ClinicalForge Complete Setup Guide

## ✅ Automated Steps Completed:
1. ✅ Environment variables configured with real Firebase credentials
2. ✅ Firebase configuration created
3. ✅ Security rules updated for aggregation queries
4. ✅ Dashboard service configured for empty data fallback
5. ✅ Application ready for deployment

## 🔧 Manual Steps Required (5 minutes):

### 1. Deploy Firebase Rules:
1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. Select project: hdms-a8e42
3. Navigate to: Firestore Database → Rules
4. Copy the entire content from firestore.rules file
5. Paste in the rules editor
6. Click "Publish"

### 2. Add Test Data (Optional - for full functionality):
1. In Firebase Console → Firestore Database
2. Create collection: clinicalLogic
3. Add 3 documents with auto-generated IDs:

**Document 1:**
```json
{
  "diseaseName": "Type 2 Diabetes",
  "diseaseType": "Chronic",
  "typicalOnsetAge": 45,
  "genderBias": "Equal",
  "urbanRuralBias": "Urban",
  "physicianName": "Dr. Sarah Johnson",
  "institution": "Johns Hopkins",
  "specialty": "Endocrinology",
  "submissionDate": "2025-07-22T11:30:00.000Z",
  "consentGiven": true,
  "userId": "user1"
}
```

**Document 2:**
```json
{
  "diseaseName": "Hypertension",
  "diseaseType": "Chronic",
  "typicalOnsetAge": 50,
  "genderBias": "Male",
  "urbanRuralBias": "Urban",
  "physicianName": "Dr. Michael Chen",
  "institution": "Mayo Clinic",
  "specialty": "Cardiology",
  "submissionDate": "2025-07-21T11:30:00.000Z",
  "consentGiven": true,
  "userId": "user2"
}
```

**Document 3:**
```json
{
  "diseaseName": "Cardiovascular Disease",
  "diseaseType": "Chronic",
  "typicalOnsetAge": 55,
  "genderBias": "Male",
  "urbanRuralBias": "Both",
  "physicianName": "Dr. Emily Davis",
  "institution": "Cleveland Clinic",
  "specialty": "Cardiology",
  "submissionDate": "2025-07-20T11:30:00.000Z",
  "consentGiven": true,
  "userId": "user3"
}
```

### 3. Restart Application:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## 🎯 Expected Results:
