# 🔧 Testing View and Update Buttons

## 🎯 **Current Status**

The View and Update buttons are now enhanced to show detailed form data, but there might be a permissions issue when fetching individual submissions.

## 🔍 **Debug Steps**

### **1. Check Console Logs**
When you click View or Update, check the browser console for:
- `Viewing submission:` - Shows the activity object
- `Activity details:` - Shows the ID and submissionId
- `Error fetching submission:` - Shows any permission errors

### **2. Expected Console Output**
```
Viewing submission: {id: "abc123", formType: "Advanced Clinical Analytics", ...}
Activity details: {id: "abc123", submissionId: "def456", ...}
```

### **3. What Should Happen**

#### **View Button:**
- ✅ Shows basic submission info (ID, status, date)
- ✅ Shows detailed form data (if permissions allow)
- ✅ Shows fallback message if detailed data unavailable

#### **Update Button:**
- ✅ Fetches submission data
- ✅ Stores in localStorage
- ✅ Redirects to form page
- ✅ Form pre-populates with original data

## 🚨 **Known Issues**

### **Firebase Permissions Error**
```
Error getting submission: FirebaseError: Missing or insufficient permissions.
```

**Cause:** The `getSubmission` method queries by `submissionId` field, but the profile page passes `activity.id` which might be the document ID.

**Solution:** The code now tries multiple approaches:
1. Query by `submissionId` field
2. Get user's submissions and find by ID
3. Show fallback basic info if both fail

## 🧪 **Test Cases**

### **Test 1: View Button**
1. Go to profile page
2. Click "View" on any submission
3. Check if alert shows detailed data
4. If not, check if fallback message appears

### **Test 2: Update Button**
1. Go to profile page
2. Click "Update" on any submission
3. Check if redirected to form page
4. Check if form is pre-populated

### **Test 3: Console Debugging**
1. Open browser console
2. Click View/Update buttons
3. Check console logs for activity details
4. Check for any error messages

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### **If View Shows Basic Info Only:**
- This is expected if permissions don't allow detailed data access
- The fallback shows basic submission info
- Check Firebase security rules

### **If Update Doesn't Work:**
- Check if localStorage has `editSubmissionData`
- Check if form page loads with pre-filled data
- Check console for any errors

### **If No Data Shows:**
- Check if user is authenticated
- Check if submissions exist in database
- Check Firebase permissions

## 📋 **Expected Results**

### **Successful View:**
```

4. **Verify form pre-population** works correctly

The enhanced functionality should now work with proper fallbacks! 🚀
